# Spam Email Classification
## Introduction
Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Decision Tree Classifier were used to detect spam on email dataset.
## Dataset: Email Dataset
## Results
In conclusion, the email spam detection models were evaluated, and the following accuracy scores were obtained:
(1) Gaussian Naive Bayes: 96.92%
(2) Multinomial Naive Bayes: 99.24%
(3) Decision Tree Classifier: 95.52%
The Multinomial Naive Bayes model demonstrated the highest accuracy at 99.24%, making it the most effective among the models tested.
